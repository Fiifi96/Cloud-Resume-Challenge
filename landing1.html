			    <h2 class="title mb-3">About Me</h2>
			    
			    <p>My experience comes from working across multiple industries and with various technology stacks has prepared me to have diverse skills set to solve business challenges and deliver the high level of performance you seek. From a background in Chemical Engineering to data analytics, logistics and Consumer discretionary I picked up very valuable skills to optimize business processes along the way.</p>
                <p>My introduction to programming came in an internship in my freshman year of college as a data analyst. I was exposed to SQL programming and data visualization for business decision making. Next in Junior year I picked up another summer internship working as a cloud architect at Lucayan, where I learnt the basics of DevOps practices in an agile workflow. At the end of the year, I got a job working for A-Plus Affordable Moving Solutions, a start-up moving company, where my goal was to configure and maintain company’s local web and database VM’s. In that job I researched on how the company’s tech workflow could be streamlined by automating tasks like pushing releases manually, testing builds and deployments. I came across AWX and Jenkins which aided me better manage configuration tasks and CI/CD.</p>
                <p>In addition, I worked on projects that involved programming knowledge (specifically MATLAB, Excel, Aspen and Python) in the calculation of equations of state of fluids, reactions of different chemicals and building a control system for a chemical process. These skills aided me to improve my automation skills with python and lessened the work load of work.</p>
                <p>Soon after I graduated, I landed a contracting DevOps/SRE role at Masonite International. In this role I worked with a small team where automation was key. I presented a couple of proof of concepts to the Dev and DevOps team, led in the migration, maintenance and configuration of cloud resources, provided on call support for production releases, and worked with QA team to develop automation scripts and unit test for various web applications.</p>
                <p>I love giving my services to help people and as a proactive problem solver, I have consistently explored multiple solutions to challenges, evaluated trade-offs, and executed the best approach for the situation. </p>
